# TO DO
Notes about different things being worked on different branches.
Helps me remember what needs to be added or worked on.

## 2020.09.20 - Add sound effects
Need to add effects to game. 4 basic bg tones added and need to play them on repeat with the gap between
each node being changed based on amount of ships on screen 

- [ ] Refactor assets loader
    - [ ] Load sprites in it's own file
    - [ ] Load fonts on it's own (Fonts module has to be initialized before use, hence own file)
    - [ ] Load sound effects on it's own (same as above)
- [ ] Make background track
    - [ ] Have delay between beeps
    - [ ] Shrink delay based on amount of ships on screen
- [ ] Change alien move speed based on amount of ships on screen
